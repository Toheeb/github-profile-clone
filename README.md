# What this is about
A showcase of my Github Profile page (the repository tab) with only html, css, and javascript. No frameworks.

## How I'm doing this
Making a JAMStack app using
- VSCode to write code.
- 11ty on Node to generate Static files
- Netlify to host
- Netlify Functions to query Github's GraphQL without a server

## What I look forward to
- Responsive & Accessible Website
- BEM styled CSS
- Vanilla JS with Fetch API
- And of course, to look exactly as that of Github's


## Preview
Visit [https://gthb.netlify.app/toheeb/](https://gthb.netlify.app/toheeb/)


## Getting Started
Fork, install all dependencies, start 11ty to serve the static files generated (no boilerplate)

```
npm start
```

You can start editing the files and viewing the results on http://localhost:8080/toheeb .
